          Hi, I'm Toby.
          <br>
          <br>
          
          A passionate software developer with a focus on creating
          innovative and efficient solutions. I have a strong background in
          developing web and mobile applications using various technologies and
          frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in software development started during my college days when I
          developed my first website. Since then, I've been constantly honing my
          skills and exploring new technologies to stay up-to-date with the latest
          trends in the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in front-end development using Angular and Ionic frameworks.
          I'm experienced in building responsive and user-friendly interfaces that
          provide a seamless user experience across different devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from coding, I'm an avid learner and enjoy staying updated with the
          latest technologies. I believe in the power of teamwork and collaboration,
          and I'm always excited to work on challenging projects that push me to
          learn and grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have any project ideas or would like to collaborate, feel free to
          reach out to me. I'm always open to new opportunities and love connecting
          with fellow developers.
